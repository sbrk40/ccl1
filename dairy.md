14.1 : I struggled with implementing the character and the enemy. I got it but they don't move and I have problems with the walls.

15.1 : Today I implemented the map and the wall with collision. Also, I have all the characters in, but I'm going to change the animations a bit. 

16.1 : I made a new background and wall objects to fit the vibe of the game to be more dark. I added a bow to collect and started making new animations for the enemy and player.
