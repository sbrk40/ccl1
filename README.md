*Reflection of the game progress*
------------------------------
Difficulties:
------------------------------
Implementing everything in time, debugging the code, keeping the code organized without getting confused
______________________________
Personal achievements:
------------------------------
Drawing everything myself, figuring out how to get a working code in the end, implementing most of the ideas I had for the game(shooting and health system)
______________________________
What I took away from the CCL:
------------------------------
Coding is much more difficult to do alone than I thought, not underestimating time and deadlines, going for easy solutions that work
