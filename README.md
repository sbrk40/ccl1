The startscreen with the start button. In the left corner there are the game rules, so the player knows the objective and the controls.

Player character:
![spritesheet_player](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b2e2162-7165-483b-921f-1b1229e39fd8)
Self drawn character sheet. The two top rows were not used, since I had difficulties implementing a complicated idle animation and calculated the frames wrong. The rest shows the different directions the character can face.

Enemies:

A spritehseet of the enemies. At first I wanted the enemies to be different creatures, but I decided that this version had a more unique look and personality.

*Reflection of the game progress*
------------------------------
Difficulties:
------------------------------
Implementing everything in time, debugging the code, keeping the code organized without getting confused
______________________________
Personal achievements:
------------------------------
Drawing everything myself, figuring out how to get a working code in the end, implementing most of the ideas I had for the game(shooting and health system)
______________________________
What I took away from the CCL:
------------------------------
Coding is much more difficult to do alone than I thought, not underestimating time and deadlines, going for easy solutions that work
